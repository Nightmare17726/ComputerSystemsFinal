  <span class="main" id="bio_cf"> <p class="bio_title">Chase Franse's Other Experiences </p> <p class="text_right_bios"> I think that MindTap was equally a waste of time, and a good resource. I understand that most of my colleagues have choosen a side on this, but I still sit somewhere in the middle. The biggest issue, in my opinion, with the MindTap lessons are the SAM Training sections. These feel like a waste of time because you have to sit through a bunch of videos just to answer some simple, common sense computer science questions. However, all of the quizzes, tests, and interactive modules throughout the semester in MindTap were actually nice and might have even taught me a thing or two. </p></span>

  <span class="main" id="bio_ch"> <p class="bio_title"> Caleb Hunt's Other Experiences </p> <p class="text_left_bios"> When it came to this class doing homework was a huge time-consuming mess at times. The videos that we were required to watch at times seemed like they didn't contribute anything to my learning experience, as it was information I knew already. Though that fact held true for most videos, some of them were quite eye opening and explained some topics I didn't know before. </p></span>

  <span class="main" id="bio_si"> <p class="bio_title"> Shane Irons's Other Experiences </p> <p class="text_right_bios"> MindTap was were most grades derived from. Most assignments, tests, and readings were through MindTap. The worst part of this was the "training" which consisted of 20-50 videos, that were non-skippable, and had questions during or after each. This took up a lot of time and often were questions that were self-explained. The tests and quizzes covered the material found in the reading and were not too easy nor too challenging. It was a good balance that matched the pace of the class, and I never felt swamped with too much work.   </p></span>

  <span class="main" id="bio_jm"> <p class="bio_title"> Jordan Mason's Other Experiences </p> <p class="text_left_bios"> Much of our at-home work was done on MindTap, where we were refreshed on basic computer concepts and taught how certain things work. The majority of our assignments were questions interlaced through a series of Youtube videos about the concept of the chapter. These were mostly informational and useful, but the questions were usually quite easy. The quizzes and tests that followed, however, were more difficult and also good learning tools. The assignments were given at a pretty forgiving pace.  </p></span>

  <span class="main" id="bio_jd"> <p class="bio_title"> Jared DeWinne's Other Experiences </p> <p class="text_right_bios"> Most of the other experience out of class was through Cengage in their MindTap program. This was where the majority of the class assignments was from readings to the tests. I didn't bother the way it was setup, other than the mandatory SAM training which was interactive videos and questions, which were unskippable. Due to this I spent much of my time watching rudimentary videos when I could've been expanding my knowledge and experience elsewhere, but I do believe there was a purpose for it.  </p></span>
