<span class="main" id="bio_cf"> <strong><u>Chase Franse</u></strong> <p class="text_right_bios"> My name is Chase Franse, I am only a simple Freshman here at Saint Leo University, with a Computer Science major and an emphasis on Information Assurance. I enjoy coding, reading, gaming, etc. This class (COM 203) is my first computer science course here at Saint Leo and I have to say that it was ... interesting. We didn't do too much in class, but with the MindTap resources I still feel like I learned a little this semester. </p></span>

<span class="main" id="bio_ch"> <strong><u>Caleb Hunt</u></strong> <p class="text_left_bios"> My name is Caleb Hunt. I'm an aspiring computer science major that wants to become an amazing video game designer. I like anime, gaming and food and I would love to travel around the world and learn many different languages. </p></span>

<span class="main" id="bio_si"> <strong><u>Shane Irons</u></strong> <p class="text_right_bios"> COM 203 class was interesting and went smoothly for me. I chose this class to gain the pre-requisite for later classes I need to take for my Computer Science degree. As for my Research topic, I chose Quantum Computing because I had no idea what it was when Professor Adams brought it up in class and was intrigued by the basic explanation he gave. </p></span>

<br>
<span class="main" id="bio_jm"> <strong><u>Jordan Mason</u></strong> <p class="text_left_bios"> COM 203 was an introductory course that refreshed much of what I've learned previously, as well introducing new tools and techniques to me. This was a necessary course as a pre-requisite for future computer classes. For my research report, I chose the Ethics of AI to get a better understanding of where the controversy lies in recent years.  </p></span>

<span class="main" id="bio_jd"> <strong><u>Jared DeWinne</u></strong> <p class="text_right_bios"> Jared DeWinne is a freshman this semester (Fall 2018) at Saint Leo University.  Jared comes from cold, chilly northeast USA, residing in his hometown of Vineland, New Jersey.  He has enjoyed this semester in COM 203, always pushing the workload to the limits, attempting to accomplish all tasks in mastery.  With his final project, Jared wishes to solve an issue seen during his time as an IT Manager at The Claridge Hotel, a Radisson Hotel, a 500 room hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey.  He wishes to find a way to ensure password security is taking seriously, without limiting accessibility of everyday users.  He believes this is a critical project and plans to continue to work on this throughout his career in his professional life.  </p></span>
