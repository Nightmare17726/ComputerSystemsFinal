  <span class="main" id="bio_cf"> <p class="bio_title">Chase Franse on GCP </p> <p class="text_right_bios"> I didn't have much experience with the Google Cloud Platform, but what experience I do have was confusing. I never ran out of credits, as I believe some other people in the class did, but I never <em> really </em> understood what I was doing. </p></span>

  <span class="main" id="bio_ch"> <p class="bio_title"> Caleb Hunt on GCP </p> <p class="text_left_bios"> My experience with the google cloud platform was relatively short so there isn't much to say on it. The process was kind of confusing, but I did end up making it work in the end. Basically, we setup a domain for a website. </p></span>

  <span class="main" id="bio_si"> <p class="bio_title"> Shane Irons on Kano Kits </p> <p class="text_right_bios"> Google Cloud Platform was a new thing for me to explore but was interesting for the assignments we had in it. Using it for the Big Queries turns out to be helpful and was an interesting task. I never ran out of credits and the time spent on the platform seemed organized and well put together. Aside from the Big Query I didnt really understand the front door backdoor section of creating a site but I can probably do it again if asked with time and some instruction.  </p></span>

  <span class="main" id="bio_jm"> <p class="bio_title"> Jordan Mason on GCP </p> <p class="text_left_bios"> Google Cloud Platform was given to students as a brief demonstration of server maintenance. We were given some credits to use, and then were taught how to responsibly and efficiently maintain a server on the Google Cloud. It took me a while to learn how it worked, but following the instructions on the Cloud was helpful and efficient.  </p></span>

  <span class="main" id="bio_jd"> <p class="bio_title"> Jared DeWinne on GCP </p> <p class="text_right_bios"> Google Cloud Platform allowed me to experiment with the on-demand type of servers Google offered, and after credit was given by Professor Adams, I was able to start my own work. This platform allowed me to host certain services and servers in general without using any of my own computerâ€™s resources other than an internet connection. The potential with platforms such as these is limitless, and it will be interesting to see what I and my other peers can do in the future with it.  </p></span>
