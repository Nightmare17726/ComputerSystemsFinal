  <span class="main" id="bio_cf"> <p class="bio_title">Chase Franse on Kano Kits </p> <p class="text_right_bios"> My experience with the Kano Kits was a little weird, but it was fun - when they worked. I think the biggest problem we had in this class was the couple of times we attempted to do something cool with the Kano Kits, but they didn't end up working for one reason or another. I'm happy we got to do the Hack Minecraft project (<a href="kano_pics.html">pictures for which can be seen here</a>) - I believe that was the pinnacle of our Kano Kit accomplishments! </p></span>

  <span class="main" id="bio_ch"> <p class="bio_title"> Caleb Hunt on Kano Kits </p> <p class="text_left_bios"> My experience with the Kano kits was relatively interesting. I didn't realize that you can have computers that small. The setup process was tedious at times when the kit refused to boot up but after getting it to work it was fun to play around with it and go different files. Basically, we put together a small computer and ran a few tasks on it. </p></span>

  <span class="main" id="bio_si"> <p class="bio_title"> Shane Irons on Kano Kits </p> <p class="text_right_bios"> In class, the Kano kits were reluctant to work a lot of the time, but the times my group got them to function, it was a cool experience with basic coding. In the kits, we set up a LAN connection chat room, which did not want to work, hacked Minecraft, created and moved around files using the command prompt, and some other activities utilizing the Kano coding. Looking past some of the faults found in the SD cards, OS, and keyboards, the Kano kits, when working properly, were a fun and innovative way for me to learn coding and system mechanics.  </p></span>

  <span class="main" id="bio_jm"> <p class="bio_title"> Jordan Mason on Kano Kits</a> </p> <p class="text_left_bios"> Our time using the Kano Kits was brief, but fixing them and figuring out how they're supposed to work was helpful in learning how networks actually functioned. It was different from trying to work with our own computers, but the various features to explore were interesting and informative. We struggled at first, but eventually figured out what we were meant to do, and learned some things about coding and networking. </p></span>

  <span class="main" id="bio_jd"> <p class="bio_title"> Jared DeWinne on Kano Kits </p> <p class="text_right_bios"> With Kano, I went a little more to the extreme side of things, by trying to configure multiple Kano kits to work with each other, communicating through a simple message python server.  This excused me from completing the Wireshark and other minor tasks, as this task was more intricate than the others.  The pictures below show my completion of the hack Minecraft project. </p></span>
